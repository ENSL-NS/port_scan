# Network Security - Portscan

Network operators actively monitor their networks to protect against various intrusion attacks. Network attackers often perform random "portscans" of IP addresses to find vulnerable machines to compromise. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) attempt to detect such behavior and flag these portscanners as malicious. In this assignment, you will analyze the NetFlow network measurement data to identify potentially malicious traffic sent to the Princeton campus network. You will then simulate an online algorithm for identifying malicious remote hosts.

This exercise was adapted from the [original exercise](https://github.com/feamster/COS461-Public/blob/master/assignments/assignment4/Assignment4_Notebook.ipynb) by Prof. Feamster:
